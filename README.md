# aws Enterprise Data warehouse components samples
Terraform and its extensive provider environment has enabled complete configurations of complex production systems build
atop of services such as VPC, S3, Redshift, Kinesis, Lambda, ECS, Fargate and others in a relatively succinct yet non-constraining ways.

The aim is to provide ready to use infrastructure templates which adhere to [aws well-architected Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/)
and showcase the use of managed services (Redshift, VPC, Kinesis), ETL pipelines, simple streaming pipelines and
serverless computing (Lambda and containers) combined with well known open source libraries and frameworks such as [dbt](www.getdbt.com/product/what-is-dbt) and [dlt](dlthub.com/) 

[//]: # (TODO: expand on best practices after first samples are added.&#41;)
Terraform [best practices](https://www.terraform-best-practices.com/) provides a good guide on code structure, naming conventions and styling, as well as community
curated modules from [terraform-aws-modules](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules), [Cloud Posse](https://github.com/cloudposse) and others.
